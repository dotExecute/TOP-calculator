The 'gotchas' were way harder to implement than the actual project steps.

I hit my limits with logical thinking. Multiple times, I couldn't spot any flaws in my logic, yet the code still broke. I tried breaking things down step-by-step, writing pseudo-code in plain Englishâ€”nothing worked. Eventually, I resorted to trial-and-error, just throwing different solutions at the problem. Surprisingly, this worked more often than proper debugging. I know this is just lack of experience showing.

This project took longer than anything I've worked on before. The days leading up to completion were filled with self-doubt, but I'm wiser for it now.
